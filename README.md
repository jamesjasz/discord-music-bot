## 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/jasz-music-bot.git
cd jasz-music-bot
npm install
````

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
DISCORD_TOKEN=your-discord-bot-token
CLIENT_ID=client-id
```

You must also [enable privileged intents](https://discord.com/developers/applications) for your bot in the Discord Developer Portal.

---

## 🧪 Usage

```bash
node index.js
```

Then in Discord:

* `j!play <url or keywords>` — Play or queue a song
* `j!skip` — Skip current song
* `j!stop` — Stop playback and clear the queue
* `j!queue` — Show the current queue
* `j!volume <1-100>` — Set playback volume
* `j!help` — Show command list

Aliases like `j!p` for `j!play` are also supported.

```bash
docker build -t jasz-music-bot .
docker run -e DISCORD_TOKEN=your-token -e CLIENT_ID=client-id jasz-music-bot
